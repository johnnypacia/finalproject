johnny's final project!

Very soon this will be a paragraph description of what I want my project to be, and what technologies I plan to use. 

AudioPhile Song Editor: This app will allow users to upload sound files, manipulate them using Web Audio API audio effects filters and save them to the database. It will use a Ruby on Rails framework to persist the song data. 

Hear a song? See the lyrics: This app listens to a segment of overhead music and by using the echoprint music-fingerprinting API. When the song/artist is identified the user will be able to see the lyrics to the song they are currently using the Lyric Wiki API. If the user likes the lyrics, they can save them to their database. This would be an express SPA.
